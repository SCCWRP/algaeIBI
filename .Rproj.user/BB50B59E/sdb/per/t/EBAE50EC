At this time, validation of the IBIs for use in streams outside of southern California has not be conducted rigorously, but preliminary analyses (<a href=\"http://ftp.sccwrp.org/pub/download/DOCUMENTS/TechnicalReports/781_CA_Perennial_Wadeable_Streams.pdf\" target='_top'>Fetscher et al. 2013</a>) suggest that the IBIs may also have applicability in other parts of the state.\n\nA template for data submission may be downloaded <a href=\"sampleTemplate.csv\" target='_blank'>here</a>\n\nMore information about this tool be obtained <a href=\"instructions.pdf\" target='_blank'>here</a>\n\n\n",
